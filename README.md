## What is PICO-8 ?

PICO-8 is a fantasy console.  
A fantasy console is a digital console, (8-bit like, in this case) which with games can be both **played** and **made**.
Cartridges are distributed iin the form of images, which contain the code, graphics, and music.

PICO-8 is made by [Lexaloffle](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

## Version Information

+ The current Pico-8 version is : `0.2.5c`
+ The current documentation on the API is at about is: `0.2.3` _and  not in a finished state!=_

There were formatting changes that needed to take precedence before I could get to the new stuff, and a lot of missed information that needed to be added. Then, after nearly completing updates to the API, a literal rampage of updates were added to Pico-8, something [@zep](https://twitter.com/lexaloffle) has never done before. So, I had a lot to do, and I do this in my spare time - so I'm doing my best to keep this relevant and current! 

I've taken notes on all the new things, and am really exploring the IDE like never before. Besides just updating my own API that I use to keep track of everything, I've uncovered multiple keyboard shortcuts that as far as I know, have **never been mentioned** and they will be added to the list soon!
